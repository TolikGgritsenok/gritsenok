   <h2><li>Introduction</li></h2>
    <strong> People have always copied things. In the past, most items of value were physical objects. 
     <br>Patent law and economies of scale meant that small scale copying of physical objects was 
     <br>usually uneconomic, and large-scale copying (if it infringed) was stoppable using 
     <br>policemen and courts.  Today, things of value are increasingly less tangible: often they are
     <br>just bits and bytes or can be accurately represented as bits and bytes. 
    </strong>
 
    <p> The widespread deployment of packet-switched networks and the huge advances
    <br>in computers and codec-technologies has made it feasible (and indeed attractive) to deliver 
    <br>such digital works over the Internet.  This presents great opportunities and great challenges.
    <br>The opportunity is low-cost delivery of personalized, desirable high-quality content.  The 
    <br>challenge is that such content can be distributed illegally.  Copyright law governs the legality 
    <br>of copying and distribution of such valuable data, but copyright protection is increasingly 
    <br>strained in a world of programmable computers and high-speed networks.

    <em>
    <br>For example, consider the staggering burst of creativity by authors of computer programs 
    <br>that are designed to share audio files.  This was first popularized by Napster, but today 
    <br>several popular applications and services offer similar capabilities.  CD-writers have become 
    <br>mainstream, and DVD-writers may well follow suit.  Hence, even in the absence of network 
    <br>connectivity, the opportunity for low-cost, large-scale file sharing exists.

   <h2><li>The Darknet</li></h2>
      Throughout this paper, we will call the shared items (e.g. software programs, songs, movies,
     <br>books, etc.) objects. <u>The persons who copy objects </u>will be called users of the darknet, and 
     <br>the computers used to share objects will be called hosts.
     <p>The darknet is the distribution network that emerges from the injection of objects according 
      to assumption 1 and the distribution of<strong> those objects according to assumptions 2 and 3. 
     </strong></p>
     <p>One implication of the first assumption is that any content protection system will leak 
      <br>popular or interesting content into the darknet, because some fraction of users--possibly 
      <br>experts–will overcome any copy prevention mechanism or because the object will enter
      <br>the darknet before copy protection occurs. 
     </p>
     <p> <strong>The term “widely distributed” </strong>is intended to capture the notion of mass market distribution 
     <br>of objects to thousands or millions of practically anonymous users.<u> This is in contrast to the  
     <br>protection of military,</u> industrial, or personal secrets, which are typically not widely 
     <br>distributed and are not the focus of this paper.

 <h3>2.1 Central Internet Servers</h3>
   <p>
   <br>By 1998, a new form of the darknet began to emerge from technological advances in several 
   <br>areas. The internet had become mainstream, and as such its protocols and infrastructure 
   <br>could now be relied upon by anyone seeking to connect users with a centralized service or
   <br>with each other. The continuing fall in the price of storage together with advances in
   <br>compression technology had also crossed the threshold at which storing large numbers of
   <br>audio files was no longer an obstacle to mainstream users. Additionally, the power of 
   <br>computers had crossed the point at which they could be used as rendering devices for
   <br>multimedia content. Finally, “CD ripping” became a trivial method for content injection.
   </p>

   <em><strong>The first embodiments of this new darknet were
   <p>central internet servers with large collections of MP3 audio files. A fundamental change 
   <br>that came with these servers was the use of a new distribution network: The internet 
   <br>displaced the sneaker net – at least for audio content. This solved several problems of the 
   <br>old darknet.  First, latency was reduced drastically. 
   </p></em></strong>
   <p>Secondly, and more importantly, discovery of objects became much easier because of 
   <br>simple and powerful search mechanisms – most importantly the general-purpose world-
   <br>wide-web search engine. The local view of the small world was replaced by a global view of 
   <br>the entire collection accessible by all users. The main characteristic of this form of the 
   <br>darknet was centralized storage and search – a simple architecture that mirrored 
   <br>mainstream internet servers.

 <h3>2.2 Central Internet Servers</h3>
   <img src="image/rat.jpg"> 
   <em>Centralized or quasi-centralized 
   <p>distribution and service networks make sense for legal online commerce.  Bandwidth and 
   <br>infrastructure costs tend to be low, and having customers visit a commerce site means the 
   <br>merchant can display adverts, collect profiles, and bill efficiently.  Additionally, management, 
   <br>auditing, and accountability are much easier in a centralized model.   
   </p></em>
   <p However, centralized schemes work poorly for illegal object distribution because large, 
   <br>central servers are large single points of failure: If the distributor is breaking the law, it is 
   <br>relatively easy to force him to stop.  Early MP3 Web and FTP sites were commonly “hosted” 
   <br>by universities, corporations, and ISPs.  Copyright-holders or their representatives sent
   <br>“cease and desist” letters to these web-site operators and web-owners citing copyright 
   <br>infringement and in a few cases followed up with legal action [15].  The threats of legal 
   <br>action were successful attacks on those centralized networks, and MP3 web and FTP sites 
   <br>disappeared from the mainstream shortly after they appeared.
